# Express Server

This express server is built with **express** + **typescript** 

As package manager I've used **yarn**

Here I will start with how I've setup the project. And issues I've faced while setting up the project and most importantly how I've fixed those issues. I want this document to work as a reminder to myself and anyone else wish to work with same setup.

## Setup

I have started with ```yarn init``` command. This created a list of files withing the project folder

```
project_folder/
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── yarn.lock
```

The **package.json** file contains

```json
{
  "name": "delete-now",
  "packageManager": "yarn@4.4.0"
}
